**Spinach Artichoke Dip**
*All herbs and spices are to taste. I did not measure these when making it.*


> ***Ingredients***
> - 4 oz Spinach
> - 4 oz Cream Cheese
> - 2 tbsp Mayonnaise
> - 2 tbsp Sour Cream
> - 1/4 cup of Grated Parmesan
> - 2/3 cup of Mozzarella
> - 14.5 oz of Artichoke Hearts
> - Garlic (I diced 4 smaller cloves)
> - Black Pepper
>
> **Instructions** 
> - Chop your spinach and dice your garlic ahead of time.
> - Heat a greased pan over medium heat, olive oil is preferred. Once warm, add spinach to oil. Cook while sitting occasionally until spinach is a rich green and is wilted. Remove from heat and let cool.
> - Preheat the oven to 350F.
> - Heat your cream cheese in a small saucepan on the stove over low heat. Once it melts enough to stir, add in the mayonnaise, sour cream, grated parmesan cheese, chopped artichoke hearts, minced garlic, black pepper, and half of the shredded mozzarella. Stir to combine.
> - When the spinach has cooled, group into a ball and squeeze to remove excess water from the spinach. Then, add to your mix.
> - Place in an oven-safe pan, I prefer it to be ceramic, smooth with spatula. Sprinkle the rest of your mozzarella cheese.
> - Bake for 30 minutes.
> - Take out and serve.
